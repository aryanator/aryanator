## 👾 About Me
- AI/ML Engineer in the streets.  
- Bad at naming variables in the sheets.  
- Building models that hallucinate slightly less than I do at 3am.  
- Once debugged for 4 hours to fix a typo. Character development.

---

## 🔥 Fun Fact
I once trained a reinforcement learning agent...  
only for it to optimize "doing absolutely nothing."  
Honestly? Respect.

# 🛠️ Tools of Chaos

- `Python` — where indentation ruins lives  
- `PyTorch` — because compiling graphs is for cowards  
- `TensorFlow` — used only when blackmailed  
- `Docker` — shipping bugs at scale
- `FastAPI` — blink and it’s deployed
- `LangChain` — linking LLMs like bad decisions
