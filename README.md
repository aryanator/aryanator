**Engineer | AI Systems | Builder**

I build scalable AI systems â€” LLM pipelines, RAG applications, GPU-optimized inference stacks â€” and deploy them into the real world.  
Not toy projects. Not playgrounds. **Deployed. Benchmarked. Live.**

---

## ðŸš€ What I Build

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems**:  
Real-time recommendation engines using LangChain, FAISS, and GPT-4o.

- **LLM Evaluation Pipelines**:  
Benchmarking hallucination rates, robustness, and reasoning in fine-tuned transformers (BART, RoBERTa, XLNet).

- **Inference Optimization**:  
Scaling model serving with TensorRT-LLM, CUDA, quantization (FP32 â†’ FP8), and real-time EC2 deployments.

- **Anomaly Detection & Cybersecurity**:  
Building RAG-based detection pipelines for PostgreSQL logs using Claude, GPT-4o, Pinecone.

- **Research Engineering**:  
Accelerating scientific modeling at Brookhaven National Laboratory (NERSC cluster) using transformer-based simulations.
